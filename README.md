# TriviaGame
* For this project, I created a trivia game.

* Here is how it works:

* The game shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, the game shows a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, it will display the next question -- doing this without user input.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

* If the player runs out of time, the game tells the player that time's up and displays the correct answer. It waits a few seconds, then shows the next question.

* If the player chooses the wrong answer, it will tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. It waits a few seconds, then show the next question.

* On the final screen, the game shows the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
